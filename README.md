# Split - an app for splitting expenses among people 

Split is a simple and intuitive expense tracker app designed to help users split expenses among friends or groups. It allows you to add expenses, view balances, settle up, and track activity logs. The app is built using Flutter and is perfect for managing shared expenses in a group.

## How to Run the App

Since GitHub cannot deploy Flutter apps directly, you can use an **online IDE** to run and test the code. Here are the steps:

---

### Using an Online IDE

1. Go to [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/) or [Zapp!](https://zapp.run/).
2. Copy the code from the repositories on the [lib folder](https://github.com/PuzzleHeaded-Look852/-App-Development-Task-Expense-Splitting-Application/tree/main/split/lib) IDE.
3. Run the app directly in your browser.

### Running Locally (if you have Flutter installed)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PuzzleHeaded-Look852/-App-Development-Task-Expense-Splitting-Application.git
   ```
2. Navigate to project directory:
   ```bash
   cd -App-Development-Task-Expense-Splitting-Application
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
