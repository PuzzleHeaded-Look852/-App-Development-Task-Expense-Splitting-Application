2.  **Copy & Paste Code:** Grab the code from the `lib` directory in this repository:  [lib folder](https://github.com/PuzzleHeaded-Look852/-App-Development-Task-Expense-Splitting-Application/tree/main/split/lib)

3.  **Run!** Click the "Run" button in the online IDE to launch Split directly in your browser.

**Option 2: üíª Run Locally (Flutter SDK Required)**
